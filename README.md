# Loan_status_prediction_pallab
Machine Learning Model for Prediction Loan Status . 

VERSION 1.0
_________________

1. The Model Comes with power of 4 models of LogisticRegression , DecisionTree Classifier , RandomForest Classifier , Support Vector Machine.
   
2. Preliminary the Best Score Arrives with LR because no Feature Engg on Feature Selection is done.
   
3. In Future Version , the hyperparameter tuning will be done.
   
4. The Visualization is made two times and first time i checked there will be no Imbalanced Dataset condition is provided data.
   
5.This Versions Model performs as per industry standard.

6. For Nominal Reason Only Accuracy Score has been taken. But later versions, come with Recall,Precision, F1 alongside Accuracy Score


VERSION 2.0
